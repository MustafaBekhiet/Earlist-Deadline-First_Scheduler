# EDF_Scheduler

Earliest Deadline First:
The first scheduler we will implement is based on the Earliest Deadline First
algorithm (EDF). EDF adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling
policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the
processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.
